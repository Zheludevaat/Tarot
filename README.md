# Tarot Explorer

This project packages the Holographic Tarot Explorer as a small Electron app.

## Running

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Start the application:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

The app runs completely offline and opens a window rendering `index.html` with interactive tarot visualization.
